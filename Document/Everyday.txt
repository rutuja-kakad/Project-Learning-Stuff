 through Oracle courses on Udemy. I'm actively expanding my project-specific knowledge through relevant courses, having completed
 software installations and thoroughly reviewed project code. Furthermore, I've achieved Ocean certifications for Java Full Stack with
 Angular at both beginner and advanced levels, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning and proficiency in cutting-edge
 technologies.
 
 
 What level of skills development is being demonstrated?
 When going through the courses like Angular and Full-stack web development I have also completed projects for hands-on practise while 
 working on this projects gone through different errors and learned more about the technology. I encountered different errors and 
 learned how to deal with them and handle this errors without damaging the program. Also learned debugging in java under the

 only reflect to continuous learning but also directly contribute to my ability to work. I am excited to leverage this new found knowledge
 to drive positive outcomes and elevate my contributions to the team and organization. As I have learned debugging tried to find the endpoint for 
 given task and with help of team learned how to get it more correct. Also learned what is the actual process when we got any task and how to start
 work on application. I have gone through document analysis and learned how to find the requirements for any task.

How to run sonarqube

java -version  --1.7.0_251
set path=C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-19.0.2.7-hotspot\bin

now sonarqube path
cd C:\vodafone\softwares\sonarqube-8.3.1.34397\bin\windows-x86-64

StartSonar.bat


Type all the above commands in one file(this is batch file) name it as Start Sonar Local.bat
and now open file manager and open this file it will open the cmd which will open the sonarqube 


If sonar didn't work on 2020 then goto the sonarqube in the conf folder sonar properties file change the port 
default port 9000

After sonar is up need to configure sonar scanner and in sonar scanner same port as of sonar qube 
Tap on the sonar scanner and right click now properties in the environment variables you need to put the path till the bin of sonar 
scanner 

After this you need to add 2 the plugin in pom.xml
this are the 2 changes we need to do in pom.xml
line 184 add this 

<plugin>
<groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
<artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>0.8.2</version>
<executions>
<execution>
<goals>
<goal>prepare-agent</goal>

</execution>
<execution>
<id>report</id>
<phase>prepare-package</phase>
<goals>
<goal>report</goal>

</plugin>

and line 22 
<sonar.host.url>http://localhost:2020</sonar.host.url>
<sonar.login>admin</sonar.login>
<sonar.password>admin</sonar.password>


Now go to sonar.properties (ctrl+sft+r)

Copy the path of the file for which you have to write unit case 
sonar.sources=./src ---- This will take the complete project if we need to only give 1/2 class then smply do this 
sonar.sources=
change the sonar-projectName= ..... this will be reflected in the sonar 

Now Open copy the folder path where our backend code is there      C:\Users\rkakad\eom-code\BE\develop
once you are on this path just hit ------ sonar-scanner   (this will run on 1.7.... our project java version ) 
sonarqube will need 11/12 to start 
And use "," for 2 files 


And for coverage you need to add jaco dependency to the pom.xml
right click on eom-Backend and Run as Maven Test (This will give you coverage of complete project)

Select Your file-> now right click and run as -> 3 unit test

Refresh
eom_code/BE/target/site/index.html'

Or just write the test cases for the file where you have made changes and run the file 
Right click the file -> Run as -> 3 unit cases 
Right click -> Coverage as -> 1 Unit case 
this will give you coverage of the file 





target->site->jacoco->index.html

INTRANET FIELDS / Internet Subnet Fields (maybe only required if we are using INTRANET)
They are not mandatory in creation however they are checked on provisioning and can give error there.
 
LAN Interne INTRANET (subnet)
Example 192.161.1.1/24
IP del CPE LAN Cliente Intranet
Should contain an Ip that is contained in the subnet above
Example 192.161.1.2/32
We need to insert a mask “/32” in example, as well even if its just an IP.
If given two values in backup and primary
must be different.
We need to insert a mask as well.
IP VRRP LAN
Only a primary field (not in backup).
Should be contained in the subnet above.
Must be different from the IP del CPE LAN Cliente Intranet(s)
We need to insert a mask, example- “/32” as well even if its just an IP.
 
During Provisioning-
LAN Master
Between the Lan Interne (indrizzo IPs), the lan master is the Ip which contains cpe ip of the primary.
The VRRP ip and the backup cpe Ip must belong to this subnet as well.
Means it will have different configuration from the other subnet  but that is something which is automatic during the provisioning.
These IPs must be different from one another and exist inside the LAN Master
VRRP IP
Backup 4G ip if it exists
The backup cpe ip if it exists.

I have added @SpringBootApplication(exclude = SecurityAutoConfiguration.class) in my main application to remove the built-in sign-in page
which spring security provides but it is causing 1 problem in the controller. And showing error at console. I have 1 service to call the
 findall() method but I have not used @autowired as it is throwing an error and if used then it compiles perfectly but once visit the
 angular page then it shows a error as "Field userService in com.cg.university.Attendance.controller.TestController required a
